This is a react project, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

The food order app enables users to order local Nigerian foods online.

This is a very responsive app that adjusts what is displayed based on different device screens. I created this responsiveness using regular pure CSS with no framework whatsoever.

## Features

Browse through the menu for different local Nigerian dishes.
Search for available dishes for quick order.
Remove/Add food to cart.
Go to order checkout.

## Unavailable
No backend.
No payment gateway (This app is just for demonstration)
